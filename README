== YubiKey NEO App: OATH

This project implement the HOTP/TOTP card functionality used on the
YubiKey NEO device that is sold by Yubico.  Its primary use is to use
the YubiKey NEO to generate OATH HOTP/TOTP one-time-passwords.

This fork mainly aims at cuting down the absurd transient memory usage
of the original ykneo-oath so it will hopefully work on more hardware
other than Yubikey NEO.

Tested working on FeiTian JavaCOS A22 and J3H145. Only TOTP works on ACOSJ Dual 95K for some reason.
